            <p>My pets! I have a cat, Smokey, and a rabbit, Holly. They're the best and mean the world to me. Smokey is 16 years old, and Holly is 4 years old. They don't really get along because Smokey doesn't understand how to play with a rabbit, so I have to keep an eye on them. Holly knows tricks too! She knows high-fives, spinning once in a circle and giving a kiss.
